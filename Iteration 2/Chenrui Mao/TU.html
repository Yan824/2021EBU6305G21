            <p>On July 7, after the Lugouqiao Incident, 
                the Nanjing Nationalist government held a series of meetings in 
                Lushan mountain to discuss the war situation. The presidents of Peking University, 
                Tsinghua University and Nankai University did not return to Beijing and Tianjin immediately after 
                the lushan meeting, but stayed in Nanjing and Shanghai temporarily. 
                On July 29 and 30, Nankai University was bombed by Japanese planes and most of its buildings were 
                burned down. On August 28, the Ministry of Education of the National Government sent 
                letters to Zhang Boling, president of Nankai University, Mei Yiqi, president of Tsinghua University, 
                and Jiang Menglin, president of Peking University, appointing three people as members of the

                schools arrived in Changsha after a long journey. October 25, changsha National Temporary University

                Associated University. The temporary university integrated the original institutions of
