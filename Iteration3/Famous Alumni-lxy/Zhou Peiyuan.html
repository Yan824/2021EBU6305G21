                    Zhou Yuanpei born on August 28, 1902 in a scholarly family in Yixing County, Jiangsu Province
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1919, he was admitted to Tsinghua School for secondary education.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1924, he graduated from the Higher Department of Tsinghua University.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He returned to China in 1929 and was hired as a professor in the Department of Physics, National Tsinghua University.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From 1936 to 1937, according to the sabbatical regulations of Tsinghua University, 
                    Zhou Peiyuan went to the United States to conduct research in theoretical physics at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1937, he returned to China on full leave.
                    Zhou Peiyuan was entrusted by the president Mei Yiqi to arrange the school to move to the south. 
                    He served as a professor in the Department of Physics of Changsha Temporary University and Kunming National Southwest Associated University successively.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1955, he was elected as a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and served as a standing member of the Department of Mathematical Chemistry.
                    <br><br>
                    Zhou Peiyuan died in Beijing on November 24, 1993.

                <p>
                    Zhou Peiyuan's academic achievements mainly lay the foundation of the turbulent model theory for the study of two important aspects of the basic theory of physics, 
                    namely the gravitational theory in Einstein's general theory of relativity and the turbulent flow theory in fluid mechanics.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of general relativity, Zhou Peiyuan has been devoted to solving the definite solution of the gravitational field equation and applying it to the study of cosmology.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of gravitational theory, he put forward the important point of view that "harmonious conditions are physical conditions", and proposed and guided the experiment of 
                    "Isotropy Test of Light Speed in Earth's Gravitational Field" by Comrade Li Yonggui of the Institute of High Energy, Chinese Academy of Sciences, etc.
