            <p>From 1943 to 1945, a total of 138 academic papers were introduced and published abroad by 
                the Sino-British Science Cooperation Hall under the auspices of Joseph Needham, of which 85% 
                were adopted by the famous journals Nature and Science. Many of them were published by scientists of the 
                United Nations General Assembly, including four by Yu Ruihuang of the Physics Department.</p>
