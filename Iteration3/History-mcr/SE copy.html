            <p>The Outbreak of the Southern Anhui Incident in early 1941 almost dragged the Anti-japanese 
                united front of the KUOMINTANG and the Communist Party to the brink of collapse. At the end of 
                the year, the United States joined the anti-fascist camp. Affected by the Southern Anhui Incident, 
                the left was forced to go underground, which declared the end of the active political atmosphere 
                during the three years of the UN General Assembly. With the United States entering the war, Chennault 
                and his flying tigers arrived in mainland China and helped repel Japanese planes, essentially 
                eliminating the threat of air raids. In the same year, inflation began to rise, eating away at the 
                limited security afforded by the general Assembly's single-minded and deep research. Since then, 
                the university has entered a period of long-term self-reliance.</p>
