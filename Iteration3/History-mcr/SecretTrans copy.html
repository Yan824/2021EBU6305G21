            <p>Tsinghua University is secretly preparing to move its campus to Changsha in case 
                the situation in Beijing becomes increasingly dire. The university allocated a 
                large sum of money to build a whole set of school buildings in Zuojialong 
                (now central South University) at the foot of yuelu Mountain in Changsha, 
                which is expected to be completed and put into use in early 1938. After the North China Incident, 
                the Japanese army attacked Tianjin on July 12. At one o 'clock in the morning of July 30, 
                Japanese troops began shelling Nankai University.
                 Nankai University was destroyed, preliminary statistics of property losses of 3 million franc.</p>
