                During the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression, 
                a total of more than 1,100 students served in the national Southwest Associated University, 
                of which 834 are inscribed on the back of the monument of National Southwest Associated University. 
                Some of them are enthusiastic young people who volunteered to join the army. 
                Mei Zuyan, son of Tsinghua University president Mei Yiqi, who was a member of the UN General Assembly 
                Committee, is one of them.
                <br>In addition to serving as interpreters, students also participated in the Chinese 
                Expeditionary Force and air Force. Between 1942 and 1945, 1,500 Chinese and American athletes 
                shed their blood to keep the "hump" of the air transport line open. According to the records, 
                among them were military students from the national Southwest Associated University.
