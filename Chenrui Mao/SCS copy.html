            <p>China's strategic counteroffensive in the Anti-Japanese War was carried out under the situation 
                that the world Anti-Fascist War took a fundamental turning point and the Japanese army gradually 
                lost its strategic initiative. In the summer and autumn of 1943, the Eighth Route Army led by the 
                Communist Party of China took the lead in north China behind enemy lines began to turn into 
                counteroffensive operations, opened the Prelude to the Partial counteroffensive of the Japanese 
                battlefield in China. Subsequently, The Chinese Indian army and the Chinese Expeditionary 
                Force also launched counter-attacks in northern Myanmar and western Yunnan. In order to save the 
                fate of defeat, in the spring of 1944, the Japanese army launched "Operation No. 1" on the front 
                battlefield of China, aiming to open up the communication line of the mainland. In the face of the 
                Desperate Japanese attack, the Kuomintang army suffered a series of defeats and even rout. 
                During this period, local counter-offensives in the liberated areas behind enemy lines led by the 
                Communist Party of China developed continuously, liberating large areas of land and population and 
                forcing the Japanese army to shrink to the points and lines in the occupied areas. The partial 
                counteroffensive of China's Anti-Japanese War firmly contained the main force of the Japanese army and 
                provided strong support to the allied attacks on Japan in other battlefields. In early August 1945, 
                the Soviet Union went to war with Japan after the United States dropped atomic bombs on the country. 
                The Chinese Communist party simultaneously launched a fierce overall counter-offensive in the liberated 
                areas and achieved brilliant results. On August 15, Japan accepted the Potsdam Proclamation and 
                announced its unconditional surrender. Japan formally signed its surrender on September 2.</p>
