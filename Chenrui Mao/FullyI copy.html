            <p>On July 7, 1937, Japan provoked the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and launched an all-out war of 
                aggression against China. The Chinese army and people rose up to resist, and the anti-japanese 
                national United front was formally formed, setting off the climax of the whole Chinese nation's 
                Anti-Japanese War. On July 16 and 17, Chiang Kai-shek, the Supreme Commander of the Republic of China, 
                issued the Chiang Kai-shek Statement on the Lushan War of Resistance in Lushan, calling on the whole 
                nation to resist the War of Resistance. On July 31, Chiang kai-shek issued a message to all the officers 
                and soldiers of the Anti-Japanese War, declaring that war had broken out.</p>
