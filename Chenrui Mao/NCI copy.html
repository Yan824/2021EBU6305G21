            <p style="width: 80%; text-align: center;">Japan adopted the policy of "separation of North China" in its specific strategy of occupying North China. 
                The implementation method of this policy is exactly the same as that of fabricating the fake "Manchukuo", 
                that is, buying off a small number of traitors, raping public opinion, fabricating the illusion of "local autonomy" 
                out of thin air, realizing "autonomy" under the threat of bayonet, and then achieving 
                "independence" under the control of bayonet. This is a ridiculous farce created by the Japanese invaders. 
                But Japan thinks this way it can hide from the public and defuse international interference. 
                The insidiousness of Japanese fascists is not without its malevolence. 
                However, the Chinese people never allowed the Plot of the Japanese aggressors to succeed and mercilessly exposed and
                 fought against them.
                  However, in the face of such an urgent situation, 
                  the Nanjing government authorities had continued to compromise and retreat to The Japanese, 
                  humiliated the country and retreated step by step, resulting in the Japanese army's insatiable and insatiable,
                 north China and the Chinese nation have unprecedented serious crisis.</p>
