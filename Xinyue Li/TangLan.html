                    Tang Lanqing was born in Xiushuidou, Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province in the 27th year of Guangxu's reign (1901). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1917, he studied medicine from Chen Zhongnan, and later opened Jinglan Hospital in Xiangjiayang, the urban area.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As early as the early 1920s, he wrote the four volumes of Shuowen Zhu, and later devoted himself to the study of bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From 1924 to 1930, he worked as a tutor in Zhou Jiayuan's family in Tianjin.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In May 1931, Tang Lan became a lecturer at Northeastern University.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1935, he became a professor at Peking University, and the next year he was the dean of the Chinese Department.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In 1940, Tang Lan was appointed as a professor in the Department of Chinese,

                <p>
                    In the aspect of ancient philology, he not only tested and explained many difficult characters, but also established a set of relatively complete and systematic research methods of ancient characters,
                     such as contrast (or comparison) method, deduction method, radical analysis method, and historical textual research method, 
                     so that the study of ancient writing got rid of the subjective speculation of the past, and embarked on a more scientific track.
                    <br><br>
                    In terms of philology, he advocated that philology should be separated from phonology and exegesis and become an independent development discipline,
                     and opposed the study of philology only as a tool for the research of other disciplines.
                    <br><br>
                    In the study of ancient history, he advocated that the stages of slave society and feudal society should be at the turn of the Western Zhou Dynasty and 
                    the Spring and Autumn Period. He puts forward his own unique views on the calculation of the Shang, Xia and Zhou chronologies, and also has a unique argument for the origin and development of bronze ware. 
                    In short, he advocated that philology, history, archaeology and other disciplines should be organically linked using the viewpoint of dialectical materialism.
