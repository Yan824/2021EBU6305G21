                <p>
                    Shen Congwen's writing style tends towards romanticism. He requires the poetic effect of the novel, 
                    which integrates realism, dream, and symbolism. The language style and sentence structure is simple, 
                    the main body is prominentand expressive, with strong richness.
                    <br><br>
                    The local color highlights the unique charm and spirit of rural human nature. Shen Congwen's novels with rural themes are typical rural cultural novels.
                    They not only contrast with the urban "modern civilization" as a whole,
                     but also focus on the rural people's life as stipulated by the collision of different cultures in the process of Western Hunan's transition to the modern world.
                    <br><br>
                    The whole work is full of worries about life and philosophical thinking about life, 
                    just like his real and tenacious life, which teaches and inspires people.
