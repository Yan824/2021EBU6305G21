                His outspoken nature led to his assassination by secret agents of the Kuomintang after eulogizing his friend Li Gongpu's life at Li's funeral in 1946.

                in the Green Lake area of Kunming. He and his wife, Gao Zhen, are buried at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing.

                    Wen Yiduo, as a vernacular poet or a classic romantic poet in the May Fourth period, often used poetry as a trumpet of propaganda, exaggerating the function of poetry,
                     instead of expressing the general emotion of human beings in traditional poetry and advocating individuality.
                    <br><br>
                    Wen Yiduo pays attention to the interpretation of original motifs in the selection of content, 
                    such as life and death, love and sorrow, faith and ideals, compassion and anger, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    Emotionally, it focuses on conveying the most common feelings of human beings, such as nostalgia, love, family, friendship, separation and so on. 
                    From Wen Yiduo's poems, on the one hand, readers hear the cry of the times, and on the other hand, they also feel the chanting from their own souls.
